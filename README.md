# 🐍 Snake Game (Python Turtle)

## 📌 Overview
A classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the **turtle graphics module**.  
Players control a snake that grows longer each time it eats food. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score without colliding with the walls or the snake’s own body.

This project demonstrates real-time game logic, keyboard controls, and basic graphics programming in Python.
